                <p>You play as an employee for the Asteroid Mining Company, collecting
                minerals from the debris of mined asteroids to provide for the company. Within
                the asteroids, there can either be calcite (57%), copper (33%), or cobalt (10%).</p>
                <img src="/images/AMCGameplayGif.gif" width="60%" alt="Gameplay gif of Asteroid Mining Company" title="Asteroid Mining Company Gameplay">
                <p>Collecting a satisfactory amount of the minerals will impress the boss, who
                will then reward you with an upgraded mining blaster and a promotion. Your barely
                reliable pathetic little laser blaster is replaced with a 7 second long destructive
                energy wave, obliterating everything in your way. From this point onward you have
                already won, and the rest of the game is just messing around with the orbital cannon
                now in your posession.<br></p>

                <p>The culmination of my time working with Unreal Engine in 2D, a side that
                is no longer offically supported or updated by Unreal Engine. I could've done better,
                but I'm working on catching up and getting projects done fast and efficiently.
                I am not a fan of Unreal Engine to be honest, I'm not a visual learner and blueprints
                feel less like coding and more like archeology, digging up bones and gluing them together.</p>

                <p>The white one is calcite, the orange one is copper, the blue-ish one is cobalt.
                I had fun with the spritework for this game, The ship, background, and regular laser
                were reused from Arcane Space War and I slightly edited the Asteroid sprite from
                Arcane Space War as well. Mostly what im referring to is the laser blast, I spent
                a whole day making a 28 frame animation for it as a small break from unreal's blueprints.<br></p>
                <p>I've learned everything I know about Unreal so far from this project and the previous smaller
                Unreal projects that came before this, so it has been a valuable development in my career, but
                I'm not particularly proud of this project. Not to say that it's bad, just not something I
                would brag about.
