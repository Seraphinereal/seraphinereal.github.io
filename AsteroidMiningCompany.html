                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Playing as an employee for the Asteroid Mining Company, mine and collect precious 
                minerals from the asteroids floating around the screen to meet quota for the company.
                Minerals to be found are calcite (57%), copper (33%), and cobalt (10%).
                <br>
                <img src="/images/AMCCalcite.png" width="6%" alt="Sprite for Calcite" title="Calcite">
                <img src="/images/AMCCopper.png" width="6%" alt="Sprite for Copper" title="Copper">
                <img src="/images/AMCCobalt.png" width="6%" alt="Sprite for Cobalt" title="Cobalt">
                <br>
                Meeting quota will impress the boss, rewarding the player with a promotion and
                access to the company's latest mining technology. Through on the spot nuclear fusion,
                promoted ships are able to fire planet destroying energy waves. Being promoted
                is the win condition, and the laser is the reward for playing.<br><br></p>

                Unreal Engine apparently no longer supports 2D directly, and has stopped updating its
                2D functionalities entirely, which made this project a bit more challenging. I am not
                the biggest fan of Unreal Engine and blueprint coding but I recognize the benefits
                of familiarizing myself with Unreal. I spent a whole day making a 28 frame animation
                for the laser as a small break from dealing with blueprint code and I have no regrets.
                This project was the culmination of many college Unreal Engine projects I didn't value
                enough to put on my portfolio.
