                <p>You play as a chemist and apple farmer, seeking to grow the Ultimate Apple.
                Slowly work your way up from a single weak apple tree to an efficient orchard by
                growing and selling apples, then purchasing upgrades at the workbench. The Ultimate
                Apple may be 1/100000, but with enough genetic engineering you'll be making them in
                no time. Upgrade your orchard until you reach the pinnacle of apple production.<br>
                Below is a showcase of the menu and early game map.</p>

                <p>I loved making this project, I was stressed as this was my final project for
                college, but I had fun with it! This was my last time using Unreal Engine for the
                foreseeable future since I will be working on a Unity project for the next while,
                and this was a lovely way to end it. I've always wanted to try making a classic
                simulator format game or an incremental and I finally did it. I always prefer Unity
                over Unreal Engine, but this project showed me how much better Unreal is for implementing
                sound effects, it is the most user friendly experience ever and I wish Unity had that.
                This project took me 3 weeks, and now I can focus on being an intern until I graduate
                in a few months!
