            <div class="font1" style="color:#eac8f5";><p>-=-   -=Game Synopsis=-   -=-</p>
                <p>You play as a chemist and apple farmer, seeking to grow the Ultimate Apple.
                Slowly work your way up from a single weak apple tree to an efficient orchard by
                growing and selling apples, then purchasing upgrades at the workbench. The Ultimate
                Apple may be 1/100000, but with enough genetic engineering you'll be making them in
                no time. Upgrade your orchard until you reach the pinnacle of apple production.<br>
                Below is a showcase of the menu and early game map.</p>

                <p>Despite being my first Unity 3D project, I was quite excited starting off
                since my previous project was C++ and SDL, I really missed the user friendly C# experience. 
                Honestly I would've liked to put more time into this project, make it look really nice and
                add a bit more content to it, but im on a streak of finishing up projects at their requirements,
                I wont have time to polish a game past its requirements for a while. This project took me 2 weeks,
                it was a nice experience learning how the provided AI works and fiddling with all the settings.
