                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                    Rogue Eras is a 2D roguelike about time travel. Starting as a knight trapped
                    in a magical tower, the player must journey through a portal that links the tower
                    to different time periods. However, the dominant forces of each era have already harnessed
                    the portals power into weapons to stop the knight from traveling further.
                    A battle between trains in an exciting western setting, raiding a steampunk
                    airship filled with mechanical advancements, a secret government facility experimenting
                    with magic body enhancement (and ninjas!), and the final destination where the
                    final boss awaits the knight.<br>
                    <br>
                    Exploring and clearing out the different time periods will award coins to spend
                    in the tower on permanent upgrades. The game is meant to be difficult, but after
                    enough playtime and upgrades bought, clearing the game eventually becomes a breeze.<br>
                    <br>
                    Every stage is filled with themed enemies and a final boss at the end, that grants
                    passage to the next time period on death. After traveling through all the time periods
                    in one run, the player can head to the final boss stage in the hopes of clearing the game.

                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                    My college internship project, I made Rogue Eras alongside the same people
                    I've previously worked with in college (Our little group got the same internship).<br>
                    Rogue Eras is an okay project, not what I wanted to make and I spent
                    a lot of the internship pushing for us to downscale the project so it could be completed
                    in time, but nobody was keen on listening to me despite being right in the end.
                    I ended up handling all of the visuals and environment aside from weapons and characters,
                    but I helped out everywhere as did everyone else.<br>
                    <br>
                    I gained more experience in a work environment, and doing online work professionally via
                    company tools and following coding standards as expected of me. Unity wise, my biggest
                    improvement was learning about timelines and becoming adept with them.<br>
