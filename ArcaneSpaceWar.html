                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Playing as a wizard in a spaceship, the goal is to fight off waves of goblins
                (also in spaceships with lasers!) while avoiding or mining asteroids that fly across
                the screen.<br><br>
                The wizard can cast ice or fire spells, toggling with a keybind. Ice spells 
                are hard to land, but will instantly freeze anything they touch. Fire spells
                are quick and easy, but do much more against frozen enemies and asteroids.

                Arcane Space War is my second solo game in Unity, I made it start to finish in
                a week and a half, I worked tirelessly all day everyday because I was determined
                to have enough spare time to implement a talent card system and new obtainable spells.
                Unfortunately We were told we had possibly just 5 days to update our portfolios and resumes
                for field placement applications, so I had to stop development early and switch my
                priorities to write this right now. If I had the time to, I was going to add
                a gravity spell that changed the trajectory of asteroids to hit enemy ships as
                an obtainable talent card.</p>

                <p>Everyone in my original group from working on Arcane Undercroft and Fell Gob
                has made several games revolving around the lineages and history of these two
                characters, so since I created the characters I thought it was about time for
                me to make my own continuation. I had a lot of fun working on this project,
                I'm happy enough with it to look into how to put it on itch.io as my first public
                project, when I have the spare time to do that of course.<br></p>
