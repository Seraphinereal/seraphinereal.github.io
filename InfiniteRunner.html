                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Infinite Runner is a sidescrolling Unity game. Cursed to run indefinitely in a procedurally
                generated map, dodge lasers and pick up extra health along the way to make it as far as possible.
                Running out of health or falling out of the world will lead to the timeloop restarting.<br>
                Projectiles come from the right side of the screen, each having a small chance to
                be an extra health instead. The player never stops running, but their speed can
                be controlled to avoid obstacles.<br><br></p>

                My first solo Unity project, made in one week. I consider this project a simple
                and somewhat presentable game that shows my capability to rapidly develop a gameplay
                demonstration in just one week, especially given that this was made when I was still
                new to Unity.<br><br>
                Seen below is a visual bug that I couldn't initially figure out how to fix during this
                project, but now I understand the issue and could fix it. Because of a specific way of using
                deltaTime, I accidentally made the game run differently across other devices, which is also
                the cause of the visual bug. The way to fix this would be to handle the generation
                in a more reliable method and fix the deltaTime code.
