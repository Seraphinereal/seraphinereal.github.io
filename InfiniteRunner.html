            Infinite Runner (no name)
            </h1>

            <div class="font1" style="color:#eac8f5";><p>-=-   -=Game Synopsis=-   -=-</p>
                <p>You play as the 'Basement Wizard' and must escape a puzzle filled dungeon.
                The puzzles are solved through the use of four spells the player can switch
                between. Fire burns wood and rope, magic missile follows your cursor, force launches
                objects that the player cant push, and ice freezes water. At the end of the dungeon
                is a cake that when collided with would play the win screen. The lore is satirical
                at best, it takes place in a time where gobby from The Fell Gob is an almighty king
                and basement wizard was locked away by king gobby in the undercroft.</p>

                <p>Arcane Undercroft was my second game, back in late February 2024.
                I developed the game alongside the same team as The Fell Gob. I spent a lot of
                time doing spritework because there wasnt a need for 4 programmers on such a
                small project, I really regretted the missed opportunity to learn more Lua
                from that project, but looking back on it I still learned some important
                things, I got experience with Love2D through managing the sprites I made.</p>

                <p>I didn't learn as much as I wanted to from this project, and unfortunately
                we moved onto C++ after this, so I finished the Lua and Love2D portions of
                the course feeling like there was more for me to learn still. I plan to dive
                into Lua more in the future for personal projects and experience.</p>
