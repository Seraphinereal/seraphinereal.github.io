                Race In A Volcano is a solo project made in Unreal. Customize, then race against an NPC
                in a lava filled volcano for two laps to win. Ram the opponent's vehicle strategically
                to send them plummeting into lava, or press the big red button in the track to open up
                a shortcut. Win or lose, the volcano will claim its victims.

                This was my first time working with Unreal Engine in 3D. This project was a mirror
                of the Unity 3D project, except we were required to code our own AI navigation
                from scratch. It was eye opening to see how simple it was to make, doing so
                raised my confidence and my understanding of coding which was obviously
                the intention. I still don't like visual coding with blueprints that much.<br><br></p>
