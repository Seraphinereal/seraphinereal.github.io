                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                Lost in the mountains, the player enters the terriroty of a master hunter.
                An endless stream of arrows rains down on the player at an increasing difficulty,
                the goal is to survive as long as possible to set a new highscore. Arrows can
                at times fall in special patterns to increase difficulty further.<br><br>

                This was a solo project for me during the first two weeks of my internship
                with Initus Interactive. I learned to create temporary audio gameObjects and hook them up
                to audio tracks that can be scaled in settings, which to my knowledge is the most efficient
                and reliable method of playing audio in Unity.<br>
                I also learned about playerprefs during this, and made use of them through the leaderboard,
                and saving settings changes. Unity continues to be my favourite engine.
                <br><br>
                I had fun making the silly little guy on the other mountain shooting all the arrows.
                If I were to revisit this project in the future I'd add abilities, levels, and attempt
                to program a starry animated night sky to replace my quick temporary sprites. I
                would also sync the players animations properly and make the character more stylized.
                Then, I would recode the arrows/targets to be independant of each other to line up
                perfectly and not impacted by incorrect arrows. I understand that what would
                make this game stand out and grow beyond this early build is to be stylized
                and have more advanced gameplay.
