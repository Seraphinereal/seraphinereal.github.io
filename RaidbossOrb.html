                <p>Raidboss Orb is a bullet hell and resource manager, with the ultimate goal of
                    unlocking new characters, new features, and having fun. After choosing a character and
                    entering a game, houses generate and populate the bottom portion of the screen.
                    After some time, a randomly chosen boss will land menacingly onto the playing
                    field, then begin their assault on the village.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The player could be considered the 'raidboss' of the village, and it is their job
                    to fend off the incoming assault on their own, but with the use of resources
                    in the area, and their skills. After the player has survived a certain amount of
                    time, the enemies will retreat, the difficulty will increase, and a new enemy will
                    approach the village once more. This loops infinitely, but provides more coins over time.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Coins are the fundamental motivator for playing the game, allowing players to purchase
                    characters and features to equip or toggle. Features change or add new things to the game
                    that can either help or hinder the player, but all in the goal of having fun, such as
                    weather conditions or terrain hazards.

                    The first character (currently known as Default), is designed to ease players into
                    the core mechanics of the game. All the abilities are simple and lean into things
                    that all characters try to utilize, such as their own resource to use,
                    mobility, defense, an ultimate for damage, and a healing move.<br>
                    <!--Video here of Default-->
                    Zealant (the second character), spreads propaganda throughout the town to
                    convert the villagers to worship them. Utilizing converted homes (Holy Homes),
                    Zealant manifests holy light to fend off enemies.<br>
                    <!--Video here of Zealant-->
                    The third character whom is not currently in the game, is the Mechanic. They will
                    defend and upgrade the village into a mechanical fortress.<br>
                    <br>
                    The only boss currently in the game is Grimkaldte, General of Hell's Army.
                    They use demonic magic to conjure minions and high-pressure attacks.

                <p>Raidboss Orb is my first project post-college that I've worked on, and I plan on
                working on it consistantly until I can post it on steam someday, although my more
                achievable goal right now is aiming to put a fun build on itch.io soon. Originally
                starting as just something to keep my skills honed, this has now become my favourite
                project I have worked on so far and I'm excited to see where I end up taking it.<br>
                <br>
                As of writing this, the game is nowhere near completion. There is currently no
                audio in the game, despite all the backend for adding in audio being complete.
                Zealant only has 2 moves, there is only one boss, there are no purchaseable extra
                features, the core content is still in development at a rapid pace.<br>
                <br>
                In my eyes, this is my best project yet and it will keep getting better. The reason
                I'm adding this to my portfolio while it's still in development, is because this is
                an important project to showcase to employers, and I want a job.<br>
