                <p style="font-size: 24px;">Game Synopsis</p>
                <p style="font-size: 19px;">Raidboss Orb is a 2D bullet hell and resource manager made in Unity,
                    with the ultimate goal of unlocking new characters, new features, and having fun. After starting
                    the game, houses generate and populate the bottom portion of the screen.
                    After some time, a randomly chosen boss will land menacingly onto the playing
                    field and begin an assault on your village.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The player could be considered the 'raidboss' of the village as it is their job
                    to fend off the assault with the use of resources in the area. After the player survives
                    enough time, the enemies will retreat and the difficulty will increase for the rest of the run.
                    After some time, a new enemy will approach the village.
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    Coins are the fundamental motivator for playing the game, allowing players to unlock
                    new characters and features to equip. Features add replayability by adding new things
                    to the game that can either help or challenge the player. Planned features are
                    weather conditions, terrain hazards, modifiers, and new resources to progress.

                <p style="font-size: 19px;">
                    The first character (Default), is designed to ease players into
                    the core mechanics of the game. All the abilities are simple and lean into things
                    that all characters try to utilize.<br>
                    <!--Video here of Default-->
                    <br>
                    Zealant, spreads propaganda throughout the town to
                    convert the villagers into worshippers. Utilizing holy homes,
                    Zealant manifests holy light to fend off enemies.<br>
                    <!--Video here of Zealant-->
                    <br>
                    The third character is the Mechanic (not currently implemented).<br>
                    Mechanic gathers scrap to create machines and upgrade
                    the village to withstand the torrent of attacks.<br>
                    <br>
                    Grimkaldte; General of Hell.<br>
                    The first boss. They use demonic magic to conjure minions and bombard the player with
                    high-pressure explosive attacks.
                    <!--Video here of Grimkaldte abilities-->
                    <br>
                    Abyssal Wretch; The Kraken.<br>
                    The planned second boss. A kraken barely holding a maintainable form, begins swallowing
                    the playing field in an ocean hazard over its duration. Fights the player with
                    powerful ancient magic and the power of a kraken.<br>

                Raidboss Orb is my first project post-college that I've worked on, and I plan to
                upload it to itch.io and steam someday after a lot more work. Originally
                starting as something to keep my skills honed, this has now become my favourite
                project I've worked on so far and I'm excited to see where I end up taking it.<br>
                <br>
                As of writing this, the gameplay loop is there but the game has a long way to go.
                There is currently no audio in the game, despite all the backend for adding in audio
                being complete. Zealant only has 2 moves, there is only one boss, there are no purchaseable
                features, the core content is still being developed.<br>
                <br>
                In my eyes, this is my best project yet and it will keep growing.<br>
                <br></p>
